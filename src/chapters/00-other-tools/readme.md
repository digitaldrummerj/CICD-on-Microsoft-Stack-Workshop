## OTHER TOOLS


To help manage the server, you may choose to install other tools.  Here's some of my favorites:

- [7 Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) - easier than the extract wizard in Windows

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - you could also choose Notepad++, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio Code, or a number of others.  You'll want one that can preserve Unix-style line endings, so avoid Notepad.
