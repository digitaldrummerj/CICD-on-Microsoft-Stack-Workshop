CI/CD ON THE MICROSOFT STACK WORKSHOP
=====================================

Welcome to the all-day workshop.  We'll start with the fresh install Windows 10 VM you brought, and we'll build a CI/CD pipeline to build a .NET Web Application using [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/).  By the end of this day, you'll have a fully functional build, and the skills you need to transform your organization with similar automation.


Prerequisites
-------------

- You need to bring a blank Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 VM.  Though an existing machine or Windows 7 or 8 *may* work, your mileage may vary.  You can spin up a free trial VM in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/free-tier/free_np/).

- Grab a copy of all the installers from one of the thumb drives going around.  If your machine is outside the conference, download the installers from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9dbIZR1TwVbQkRwUUxqZFVxMlU).  A few of the files on Google Drive are text files noting where to download the real installer and the file size.


Tasks
-----

We'll discuss many best practices throughout this workshop, but the majority of the experience is a self-directed journey through installing and configuring each tool.  Work as quickly or as slowly as you'd like.

Each folder has a README.md file that walks you through the steps for this task.  When you're ready, open up the Step 0 folder.
